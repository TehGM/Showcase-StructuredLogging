# 3 - JSON
This example adds a new file sink, that outputs logs as JSON.

This is where structured logging benefits start to really show. JSON is machine readable, so such logs can be used for any automated processes.

However, JSON files are just a simple example - further examples will make actual use of this Structured Logging feature.
